<h1> Indoor Tips</h1>
  <ol>
  <strong><li>Insulate house</li></strong>
    <p> Try covering your windows with drapes/curtains. Or, you could place aluminum foil on the windows to reflect sun rays from entering the inside.  </p>
  <strong><li>Have air conditioning</li></strong>
    <p>If there is no air conditioning in the building, leave and go to a public library or community center with AC.</p>
  <strong><li>Don't rely solely on fan</li></strong>
    <p> A fan may help you for a short period, but it is not the most practical way to stay cool. </p>
    <strong><li>Limit stove and oven use</li></strong>
    <p> Stoves and ovens can make a buildingâ€™s overall temperature heat up very quickly and it can be hard to cool the building back down.</p>
    <strong><li>Drink plenty of water</li></strong>
    <p>Cool water can lower the body's internal temperature, so drink lots of it. Also, limit dehydrating drinks such as alchohol.</p>
</ol>

	<h1> Outdoor Tips</h1>
	<ol>
  <strong><li>Wear sunscreen</li></strong>
    <p> Sunburn affects the body's abiltiy to cool down and can make you dehydrated.</p>
  <strong><li>Limit outdoor activity</li></strong>
    <p>Outdoor activity, especially if it's strenous, can make a person exhausted. So, if you are trying to go outside, it is better to go early in the morning or in the evening.</p>
  <strong><li>Wear clothing fit for the temperature</li></strong>
    <p> Clothes that are loose, light weight, and lightly colored can help you stay cool during the heat.</p>
    <strong><li>Stay wet</li></strong>
    <p> Before going out, try drenching your shirt with cool water, or shower with cool water before and after going out. Cool water is very beneficial in the heat.</p>
    <strong><li>Take breaks</li></strong>
    <p>If being outside becomes too much for the body, rest in shade or seek an air conditioner before returning outdoors.</p>

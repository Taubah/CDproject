  <p> The long-term heating of the Earth's suface is known as global warming. Global warming has been observed since about the 1850s-1900s. Human actions, such as fossil burning affect global warming by trapping greenhouse gas levels into the Earth's atmosphere. </p>
  <p> Greenhouse gases absorb the thermal energy from the sun that radiates to the Earth's surfac and prevent that heat from going into space. Greenhouse gases are helpful because they sustain life on Earth, but too much can make temperatures rise to deadly levels. According to CNN, " the average global temperature reached 17.01 degrees Celsius (62.62 Fahrenheit)" on July 4, 2023.</p>
